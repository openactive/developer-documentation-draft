# Broker Roles

A Broker is an actor that arranges transactions between a Seller and Customer, either directly or indirectly.

From a contractual and taxation perspective, there are two types of Broker: agents (`AgentBroker`), and resellers (`ResellerBroker`). In addition, situations in which the customer contracts directly with the seller without a third party are represented by the `brokerRole` value of `NoBroker`.

The Open Booking API does not deal with contractual relationships, and simply provides a mechanism to record bookings
