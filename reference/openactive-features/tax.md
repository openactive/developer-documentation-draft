description: Ensuring tax receipts can be correctly generated by the Broker

# Tax

Due to the variety of business models in use in OpenActive, the Booking System _must not_ send receipts directly to the Customer for `AgentBroker` and `ResellerBroker` bookings.

For each successful booking operation, the Broker _must_ generate a new Invoice in the form of a tax receipt, on the basis of the response from **B**. To ensure that the Customer is provided with the correct tax receipt, if `totalPaymentTax` is provided in an `Order` from **B** or subsequently in the Orders feed, the Broker _must_ generate a new or updated Invoice and either (a) send a tax receipt representation of the Invoice to the Customer and/or (b) offer a means to allow the Customer to easily retrieve a full tax receipt representation of the specific version of the Invoice at any future date for any previous booking made. As it is ultimately the Seller's responsibility to send tax receipts, they need to be confident that the Broker is making tax information available to its Customers in an accurate and timely manner.

The tax receipt sent by the Broker _must_ comply with any legal requirements of the jurisdiction of operation.

Note that if the specification is followed correctly, for all Broker modes where a Seller may need to supply a tax receipt manually for any reason, the Seller will have sufficient details of the Customer and of the transaction to generate the most recent tax receipt.
