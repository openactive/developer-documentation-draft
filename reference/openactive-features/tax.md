# Tax

Due to the variety of business models in use in OpenActive, the [Booking System](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/1.0CR3/#dfn-booking-system) _must not_ send receipts directly to the [Customer](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/1.0CR3/#dfn-customer) for `AgentBroker` and `ResellerBroker` bookings.

For each successful booking operation, the [Broker](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/1.0CR3/#dfn-broker) _must_ generate a new [Invoice](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/1.0CR3/#dfn-invoice) in the form of a tax receipt, on the basis of the response from [**B**](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/1.0CR3/#dfn-b). To ensure that the [Customer](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/1.0CR3/#dfn-customer) is provided with the correct tax receipt, if `totalPaymentTax` is provided in an `Order` from [**B**](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/1.0CR3/#dfn-b) or subsequently in the [Orders feed](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/1.0CR3/#dfn-orders-feed), the [Broker](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/1.0CR3/#dfn-broker) _must_ generate a new or updated [Invoice](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/1.0CR3/#dfn-invoice) and either (a) send a tax receipt representation of the [Invoice](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/1.0CR3/#dfn-invoice) to the [Customer](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/1.0CR3/#dfn-customer) and/or (b) offer a means to allow the [Customer](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/1.0CR3/#dfn-customer) to easily retrieve a full tax receipt representation of the specific version of the [Invoice](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/1.0CR3/#dfn-invoice) at any future date for any previous booking made. As it is ultimately the [Seller](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/1.0CR3/#dfn-seller)'s responsibility to send tax receipts, they need to be confident that the [Broker](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/1.0CR3/#dfn-broker) is making tax information available to its [Customers](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/1.0CR3/#dfn-customer) in an accurate and timely manner.

The tax receipt sent by the [Broker](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/1.0CR3/#dfn-broker) _must_ comply with any legal requirements of the jurisdiction of operation.

Note that if the specification is followed correctly, for all [Broker](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/1.0CR3/#dfn-broker) modes where a [Seller](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/1.0CR3/#dfn-seller) may need to supply a tax receipt manually for any reason, the [Seller](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/1.0CR3/#dfn-seller) will have sufficient details of the [Customer](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/1.0CR3/#dfn-customer) and of the transaction to generate the most recent tax receipt.
