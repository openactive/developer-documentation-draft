# Details Capture

The specification includes provision to capture of the following details related to the [Customer](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/1.0CR3/#dfn-customer) (the actor who is booking), with only the e-mail address being required.

* E-mail address (`email`)
* Forename (`givenName`)
* Surname (`familyName`)
* Telephone (`telephone`)

Note that these are _not_ the details of attendees, and that the [Customer](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/1.0CR3/#dfn-customer) is not guaranteed to participate in the activity. This facilitates child booking as the [Customer](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/1.0CR3/#dfn-customer) can easily book on behalf of a child, without supplying the child's own personal details.
