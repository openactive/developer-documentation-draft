# How to use the docs

This documentation is here to help you become part of the OpenActive eco-system by enabling your booking system to open it's data to applications, and allow those applications to make bookings.

There are three main areas of this documentation&#x20;

1. Getting started. This section outlines what this documentation is for, how to use it, and any supporting information or tools you may need.
2. Guides. This section has two guides that will walk you through:
   * Creating Open Opportunity Feeds so you can share your booking system events with other applications
   * Creating an Open Booking API so that other applications can make orders based off of the information in your Open Opportunity Feeds.
3. Reference. This section contains the underlying technical details for different elements involved in the implementation outlined in the guide.

If you follow the guides, page-by-page in order you will be taken step-by-step how to implement Open Opportunity Feeds followed by the Open Booking API, without any need for prior knowledge. Where possible the guides have been written so that you can refer back to them, without needing to go through step-by-step.
