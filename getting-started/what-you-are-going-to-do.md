# How to use the docs

This documentation is here to help you become part of the OpenActive eco-system by enabling you to open the data in your booking system to other applications, and to enable those other applications to make bookings.

There are three main areas of this documentation&#x20;

1. Getting started. This section outlines what this documentation is for, how to use it, and any supporting information or tools you may need.
2. Guides. This section has two guides that will walk you through:
   * Creating Open Opportunity Feeds so you can share your booking system events with other applications
   * Creating an Open Booking API so other applications can make orders based on the information in your Open Opportunity Feeds.
3. Reference. This section contains the underlying technical details for different elements involved in the implementation outlined in the guide.

If you follow the guides page-by-page in order, you will be guided step-by-step on how to implement Open Opportunity Feeds followed by the Open Booking API, without any need for prior knowledge. Where possible, the guides have been written so that you can refer back to them without needing to go through them step-by-step.

Throughout the guides, you will also see links to tools that will help you test your implementation, such as a validator, test-suite or postman link. For now, let's look at what OpenActive is, so you have a firm understanding of the context you'll be operating in. &#x20;
