# OpenActive overview

OpenActive is a community-led initiative to help people in England get active using open data.

**Research from Sport England shows that one fifth of adults have been put off doing a physical activity because it was too difficult to find or book online.**

OpenActive is run by a community of volunteers from across the physical activity sector, and is backed by grant funding from Sport England and DCMS. The ODI are key partners to the initiative, and host OpenActive.&#x20;

The initiative has a simple governance structure â€“ a steering committee who sets the direction for the initiative, practitioners forums to provide a home for the people involved in the practical work around OpenActive, an executive function to oversee delivery, and a W3C standards working group who maintain the data standards that OpenActive relies on for its technical operation.
