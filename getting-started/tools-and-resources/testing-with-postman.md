# Testing with Postman

This Postman workspace, alongside the validator, are the primary tools you will be using to test your implementation as you build it.&#x20;

Postman is an API tool - it enables you to generate test requests to your local implementation and tests whether the response you are providing is correct.&#x20;

??? Install postman instructions ??? Finalise once all postman has been added
