# Adding necessary features

We have a minimal booking system that passes the core tests of the open active test suite. However it is probably missing features of your booking system. The Open Booking API standard has been developed in partnership with several large and small booking systems, and therefore likely has the additional features your system needs.

Here are the most common features:

* **Broker Roles** - Relationship between the Broker and Seller
* **Payment & Free Bookings** - Accepting payment and/or handling free bookings
* **Prepayment** - Permitting bookings where payment is accepted upon arrival
* **Booking Restrictions** - Restrictions on the circumstances in which bookings can be made
* **Cancellation** - Support for cancellation, both triggered by the Customer and by the Seller
* **Leasing** - Reserving items during the booking journey
* **Details Capture** - Capturing details about the customer or attendee
* **Access Control** **& Online Attendance** - Barcodes, PIN codes, and Online Video URLs
* **Tax** - Ensuring tax receipts can be correctly generated by the Broker
* **Notifications** - Notifications of changes to a confirmed booking
* **Terms -** Displaying terms and policies

## Planning

First identify which features are part of your existing booking system, then split them in to three categories:

1. Features required for your booking system to work at all
2. Features required to give Open Booking users a good experience of your system
3. Features that enhance booking through your system, but are not essential

Obviously you must implement all features from (1) before you can make your API publicly available. We also strongly recommend implementing all features from (2) before going live, particularly if you have a multiple seller system, to avoid customers booking through your API from having a lesser experience.

## Implementing features

Most features simply require exposing more fields in your API responses, though some are more involved. The OpenActive test suite has tests for most features, and we will go over how to configure for your booking system's feature-set below.

Reference documentation for all features can be found here (LINK).

We will go through adding one of the most common features, payment and free bookings, and the steps will be similar for adding most other features.&#x20;
