# Adding necessary features

We have a minimal booking system that passes the core tests of the open active test suite. However it is probably missing features of your booking system.&#x20;

Open Active booking API likely has the features your system needs.

Here is a list of the most common features:

* **Broker Roles** - Relationship between the Broker and Seller
* **Approval Flow** - Allow bookings to be approved by the Seller before they are confirmed
* **Authentication** - Securing the connection to the Open Booking API (for multiple seller systems this requires OpenID Connect Authentication Flow, otherwise API keys or OpenID Connect Client Credential Flow may be used)
* **Payment & Free Bookings** - Accepting payment and/or handling free bookings
* **Prepayment** - Permitting bookings where payment is accepted upon arrival
* **Booking Restrictions** - Restrictions on the circumstances in which bookings can be made
* **Cancellation** - Support for cancellation, both triggered by the Customer and by the Seller
* **Leasing** - Reserving items during the booking journey
* **Details Capture** - Capturing details about the customer or attendee
* **Access Control** **& Online Attendance** - Barcodes, PIN codes, and Online Video URLs
* **Tax** - Ensuring tax receipts can be correctly generated by the Broker
* **Notifications** - Notifications of changes to a confirmed booking
* **Terms -** Displaying terms and policies

As an example, your system might do X, in which case&#x20;

You can see the whole list here: LINK TO FEATURES

Split them in to three categories:

* Features required for your booking system to work at all
* Features required to give Open Booking users a good experience of your system
* Features that enhance booking through your system, but are not essential

Identify how these map on to the Open Booking API features.
