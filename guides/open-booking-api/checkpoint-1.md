description: Create your first endpoint for the Open Booking API.
---

# Checkpoint 1 (C1)

Now you have an understanding of how the booking flow works, and have understood how your own database maps to the objects required we can get started.

### Endpoint URL

Firstly you should decide on the `baseUri` to form a namespace for your implementation of the API (e.g. `/openactive/api`)

{% hint style="info" %}
Set your`DatasetSiteUrl`in your dataset site template to this `baseUri`. It will be the homepage for your Open Booking API, making it easy to discover.
{% endhint %}

Next, create a route in the following format that can receive a PUT request&#x20;

`PUT {baseUri}/order-quote-templates/{uuid}`

A Broker will call this endpoint after a Customer selects an Opportunity from your feed.

{% hint style="info" %}
Reminder - an opportunity is an instance of an event e.g. "Yoga Tuesday 14th 7pm"&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Testing with Postman

{% hint style="info" %}
You'll need to have installed Postman and set up the workspace, instructions for this can be [found here](../../getting-started/tools-and-resources/testing-with-postman.md).
{% endhint %}

We are now going to test with Postman, you'll find links throughout the guide but this first one we will take you through step-by-step.

Click on the collection called "Open Booking API" and click on the "Variables" tab, set the baseUri to the URI you chose.&#x20;

Select the end point in the collection called "Checkpoint 1 (C1)".&#x20;

Click "Send"

You should see the response from your end point in the body tab.

You should see the first test has passed under the "Test Results" tab, and the rest should have failed.

We will move on to ensuring your response to a request at this endpoint passes all tests.&#x20;

### Request

The C1 endpoint acts as a "dry-run" of the order to confirm the details of the opportunity, your system will return a response that looks broadly similar to a finished booking.

Here's what a request will look like:

<details>

<summary>Example C1 request</summary>

```
{
  "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
  "@type": "OrderQuote",
  "brokerRole": "https://openactive.io/AgentBroker",
  "broker": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "MyFitnessApp",
    "url": "https://myfitnessapp.example.com",
    "description": "A fitness app for all the community",
    "logo": {
      "@type": "ImageObject",
      "url": "http://data.myfitnessapp.org.uk/images/logo.png"
    },
    "address": {
      "@type": "PostalAddress",
      "streetAddress": "Alan Peacock Way",
      "addressLocality": "Village East",
      "addressRegion": "Middlesbrough",
      "postalCode": "TS4 3AE",
      "addressCountry": "GB"
    }
  },
  "seller": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "@id": "https://example.com/api/organisations/123"
  },
  "orderedItem": [
    {
      "@type": "OrderItem",
      "position": 0,
      "acceptedOffer": {
        "@type": "Offer",
        "@id": "https://example.com/events/452#/offers/878"
      },
      "orderedItem": {
        "@type": "ScheduledSession",
        "@id": "https://example.com/events/452/subEvents/132"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

</details>

Here's a breakdown of the key fields in this request:

* @context is a JSON-LD concept that shares the URL where the definition of the API can be found, particularly a definition of the different @type's.&#x20;
* @type is the object that is being used as part of this request, in the case `OrderQuote`
* brokerRole & broker are fields that identify who the broker is, and contain information that will eventually be used in authentication.
* seller is the organization or person providing access to events or facilities.
* orderItem is an array of items that make up the OrderQuote
  * Each orderItem has an @id which is unique URI (that does not need to be an actual working link but a unique identifier) and a @type which corresponds to the type of orderItem (??? link to item types ???)

??? check whether request is valid ???

### Response

### Error handling

If the items being ordered can no longer be ordered, for example if all the available slots for an event have been booked you should return a 409 error. Here's an example:&#x20;

??? Postman link here for error ???

If for some reason there is an error outside of the orderQuote you should respond with a 500 error. Here's an example:&#x20;

??? If there are issues with other properties of the `OrderQuote` outside of `orderedItem`, the [Booking System](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/1.0CR3/#dfn-booking-system) _must_ respond with a JSON-LD response which includes only the appropriate `OpenBookingError` and the appropriate status code ???
