description: Create your first endpoint for the Open Booking API.
---

# Checkpoint 1 (C1)

Now you have an understanding of how the booking flow works, and have understood how your own database maps to the objects required we can get started.

### Endpoint URL

Firstly you should decide on the `baseUri` to form a namespace for your implementation of the API (e.g. `/openactive/api`)

{% hint style="info" %}
Set your`DatasetSiteUrl`in your dataset site template to this `baseUri`. It will be the homepage for your Open Booking API, making it easy to discover.
{% endhint %}

Next, create a route in the following format that can receive a PUT request&#x20;

`PUT {baseUri}/order-quote-templates/{uuid}`

A Broker will call this endpoint after a Customer selects an Opportunity from your feed.

{% hint style="info" %}
Reminder - an opportunity is an instance of an event e.g. "Yoga Tuesday 14th 7pm"&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Testing with Postman

{% hint style="info" %}
You'll need to have installed Postman and set up the workspace, instructions for this can be [found here](../../getting-started/tools-and-resources/testing-with-postman.md).
{% endhint %}

We are now going to test with Postman, you'll find links throughout the guide but for this first one we will take you through step-by-step, ensure you've run the through the [Postman setup first](../../getting-started/tools-and-resources/testing-with-postman.md).

* Select the "Open Booking API" collection
* Ensure the Broker Microservice is running in the background.
* Select the `GET Sample X (Simple)` request (where `X` is your desired opportunity type)
* Click 'Send' and see a response body containing a randomly selected opportunity, which is used to parameterise the other requests in Postman.
* Select the `PUT Checkpoint 1 (C1)` request
* Click 'Send' and if your C1 request is set up correctly you'll see a 200 status response, with a body containing a correctly formatted OrderQuote. For now you will see an error, since you have not set up your endpoint yet.

### Request

The C1 endpoint acts as a "dry-run" of the order to confirm the details of the opportunity, your system will return a response that looks broadly similar to a finished booking.

Here's what a request will look like:

<details>

<summary>Example C1 request</summary>

```
{
  "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
  "@type": "OrderQuote",
  "brokerRole": "https://openactive.io/AgentBroker",
  "broker": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "MyFitnessApp",
    "url": "https://myfitnessapp.example.com",
    "description": "A fitness app for all the community",
    "logo": {
      "@type": "ImageObject",
      "url": "http://data.myfitnessapp.org.uk/images/logo.png"
    },
    "address": {
      "@type": "PostalAddress",
      "streetAddress": "Alan Peacock Way",
      "addressLocality": "Village East",
      "addressRegion": "Middlesbrough",
      "postalCode": "TS4 3AE",
      "addressCountry": "GB"
    }
  },
  "seller": "https://example.com/api/organisations/123",
  "orderedItem": [
    {
      "@type": "OrderItem",
      "position": 0,
      "acceptedOffer": "https://example.com/events/452#/offers/878",
      "orderedItem": "https://example.com/events/452/subEvents/132"
    }
  ]
}
```

</details>

Here's a breakdown of the key fields in this request:

* `@context` is a JSON-LD concept, it is a URL that points to the definitions of properties for the API, particularly a definition of the different types.&#x20;
* `@type` is the object that is being used as part of this request, in the case `OrderQuote`
* `brokerRole` & `broker` are properties that identify who the broker is, and contain information that will eventually be used in authentication.
* `seller` is the organization or person providing access to events or facilities.
* `orderItem` is an array of items that make up the `OrderQuote`
  * Each `orderItem` has a `@id` which is unique URL (that does not need to be an actual working link but a unique identifier) and a `@type` which corresponds to the type of `orderItem`.

{% hint style="info" %}
These guides will mention the key properties in requests and responses, for the details of every property used, head to the reference section (reference link).

* `bookingService` is a property that contains details about your booking system, like it's `name` and `url`
* `orderRequiresApporval` is a boolean property that indicates if the `OrderItem`'s require approval.&#x20;
* `totalPaymentDue` is a property that outlines the specification of the price, for example the cost and currency.
* `totalPaymentTax` is a property that outlines the specification for the tax, for example the amount of tax due, the name of the tax.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You can choose to use the `lease` field in your response to hold the booking for the customer, this can be extended or created as part of checkpoint 2 (C2).
{% endhint %}

You can now run the `PUT Checkpoint 1 (C1)` [Postman request](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/21015180/Uz5DqdCf), and if you've set this up correctly your should see a response that matches the example above.&#x20;

You can run the [OpenActive Validator](https://validator.openactive.io/) to check that your response is formatted correctly. You can remind yourself of how to use the OpenActive Validator [here](../../getting-started/tools-and-resources/#openactive-validator). &#x20;

### Error handling

#### OrderItem errors

If the items being ordered can no longer be ordered you should return an `error` with the relevant `OrderItem` along with the HTTP status code "409 Conflict". For example if all the available slots for an event have been booked:

<details>

<summary>Example 409 error</summary>

</details>

Only the `@type` field is required in the error. However for a better debugging experience for both users of your API and yourself you should also include a `description` field that describes why the error occurred in this particular case. There are other optional fields you may include in your errors if they are helpful:

* `name` A short, human-readable summary of the problem type. It should not change from occurrence to occurrence of the problem.
* `instance` A URI reference that identifies the specific occurrence of the problem.
* `statusCode` An integer representing the HTTP status code.
* `requestId` An ID for the request to help technical support debug problems in production.

There are a number of error `@type`s in the Open Booking API. For any `OrderItem` related errors use an error `@type` from the [10.2.2.3 Order Creation - `OrderItem` Errors](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/1.0CR3/#order-creation-orderitem-errors) section of the Open Booking specification.

#### Other errors

For errors in any other part of the request you should return just the error, not the full `OrderQuote` object. For example if the broker details supplied are not valid:

<details>

<summary>Example 400 error</summary>

```
{
  "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
  "@type": "IncompleteBrokerDetailsError",
  "description": "The broker property supplied is not a valid Organisation object"
}
```

</details>

There are many possible errors, all valid error `@type`s can be found in the [10.2 Error Model](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/1.0CR3/#error-model) section of the specification. When deciding what to return in your errors:

* Always prefer a more specific error `@type` to a less specific one.
* The HTTP status code returned must be the status code required in the specification for the error `@type`.
* `description`s can be different for errors with the same `@type`.
* It is better to give too much information in the `description` than too little.

#### Example errors in the Validator

Example error responses can be found in the [Validator](https://validator.openactive.io/) under the "Samples" menu as shown below.
