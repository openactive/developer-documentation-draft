# Validating your feed

Now you have a feed setup and learnt about potential pitfalls, it's time to double check that your feed is valid and operating correctly.&#x20;

* Double check the feed using the [OpenActive Validator](https://validator.openactive.io/rpde), you will want to use a tool such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to place your local implementation on a URL that can be accessed (??? step by step for this)
* You will then want to run your implementation against the OpenActive test suite, it could be helpful to place your implementation on a staging URL for this.

??? How to implement the test suite for this ???

You should run these two validations steps by each of the feeds you create to ensure they are functioning correctly.&#x20;
