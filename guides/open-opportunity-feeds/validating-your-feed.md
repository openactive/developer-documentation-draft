# Validating your feed

Now you have at least one valid feed set/group which conforms to the RDPE format we will do the following:

* Double check the feed in the validator
* Check your feed with the open active test suite
* Might need to deploy to a staging environment to do this
* Get your other feeds up to this point, then repeat the above tests
