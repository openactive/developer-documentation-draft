# Scheduled Session Data

Mention that there are libraries for Ruby, .NET, PHP, JS to help.

Empty objects/arrays/strings and nulls should be removed from items

Example mapping exercise

* Say you have these tables
* You would need to do a query like this:

```
SELECT ... JOIN ... LIMIT 10
```

It might not be easy or even possible to do it in one query, don't worry about being performant or elegant, just get the right data out.
