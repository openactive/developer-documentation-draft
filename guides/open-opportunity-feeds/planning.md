What are the feeds for

What kind of data do they contain

Events -> sub/super events

## How does my data map on to the OpenActive data model?

What data is in my system?

How does this map the models/tables on to the OpenActive entities that align

Maybe a table to help?

In the rest of the guide we will concentrate on SessionSeries/FacilityUse because they are the most common

## Which feeds are required

You should use separate feeds for all event types for reasons (see: [https://developer.openactive.io/publishing-data/data-feeds/types-of-feed#exposing-the-model-in-feeds](https://developer.openactive.io/publishing-data/data-feeds/types-of-feed#exposing-the-model-in-feeds))
