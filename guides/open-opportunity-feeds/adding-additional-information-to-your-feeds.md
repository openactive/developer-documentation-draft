# Adding additional information to your feeds

You're OpenActive feed needs to give the same information for booking as your booking system does  if you want it to be used correctly. The best approach is consider the information that is currently in your system and how that maps to the different feeds you would like to publish.&#x20;

In order to compare your system with the required, recommended and optional properties of each of the feeds you should use the references that we have provided for each type.

Here are the categories of feeds discussed earlier (LINK ???) and the objects that make them up.

Recurring classes and sessions - feeds scheduledsession and sessionseries

Facility and slots - feeds facillityUse, individualfacilityuse

AdHoc - Event and EventSeries

Headline - Headline Event and Event

Course - Course instance

All of the different types of objects used in the OpenActive eco-system can be found in the references here (??? LINK)
